This is a sample Image Classifier built with javascript and working only client-side. This is the homework assignment of first week for [MMWML course](https://www.machinelearningcourse.io/courses/make-money).

## Troubleshooting

This piece of code heavily depends on [cors-anywhere](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/) to avoid issues with [CORS](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-cors). If this server is down you may have difficulties with web component. Then a solution is to disable temporarily CORS on your browser as explained [here](https://pointdeveloper.com/how-to-bypass-cors-errors-on-chrome-and-firefox-for-testing/).
